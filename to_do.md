   - Ensure proper handling of protein file formats and preprocessing steps.

4. **Develop Comprehensive Results Database Schema (`models/models.py`)**
   - Expand database models to include detailed docking results and metadata.
   - Optimize database queries for efficient data retrieval.

5. **Implement Error Handling and Retries**
   - Enhance task queue management to handle various failure scenarios.
   - Implement logging for better monitoring and debugging.

## Low Priority
6. **Expand API Functionality (`api/main.py`)**
   - Add endpoints for batch job submissions.
   - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.

7. **Optimize Caching Strategies**
   - Fine-tune Redis caching for better performance.
   - Implement cache invalidation policies as needed.

8. **Write Unit and Integration Tests**

# 2. Finalize `docking/docking.py` Script

We'll now focus on **Task 1: Finalize `docking/docking.py` Script**. This involves implementing the actual docking functionality using AutoDock Vina, integrating RDKit for SMILES to 3D conversion, handling PDBQT file generation, executing Vina docking, and parsing the results.
